          Elena is a joy to work with. She went the extra mile at every ocasion to provide assets that
          had great quality and were technically very easy to work with for us developers. She also have a great
          understanding of technical limitations and instrinsics of real time 3d and knows how to optimize models for that use case. Also her creativity was simply mind numbing at some times!
